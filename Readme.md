### üìã Supported routes and responses

Each route has a designated REST controller and a corresponding DTO.

**Where .../ represents the base url.**

PUT .../students/{uuid}
DELETE .../students/{uuid}
```
Where the search route is a paginated search.

Each "students" route has a DTO that must contain the following fields for POST, PUT requests AND for responses:
```
{
    "name": "student name",
    "registry": "NNNN00",
    "grade": "N0"
}
```
Where no fields can be null. The maximum name size is 100.

Where the registry must follow the "[A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][A-Z][0-9]+" regexp pattern and cannot be duplicated.

    "roomId": "roomUUID"
}
```
Where no fields can be null. Where the code has a size of 5 and follows the "[A-Z][0-9]+" regexp pattern.

Where the schedule must be on the "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss" date formatting.

Where the professorId and roomId values must be valid within the data storage.

Each "classrooms" route has the following DTO body for GET responses:
